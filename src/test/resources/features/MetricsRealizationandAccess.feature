Feature: Metrics Realization and Access

  As an administrator or stakeholder
  I want to access realized metrics from collected data
  So that I can analyze the metrics for informed decision-making

  Scenario: Accessing order volume metrics over time for all users
    Given order volume data has been collected
    When I request to view order volume metrics
    Then the system should provide time series metrics of order volumes

  Scenario: Restaurant managers accessing metrics for their restaurant
    Given restaurant-specific data has been collected
    And I am logged in as a restaurant manager
    When I request metrics for my restaurant
    Then the system should provide metrics on order volumes, delivery efficiency, and popular menu items

  Scenario: Accessing delivery location metrics for all users
    Given delivery location data has been collected
    When I request to view delivery location metrics
    Then the system should provide metrics representing delivery locations

  Scenario: Accessing user behavior metrics for all users
    Given user behavior data has been collected
    When I request to view user behavior metrics
    Then the system should provide metrics detailing user ordering patterns and preferences
