Feature: Operational Data Collection

  As a system
  I want to collect operational data accurately and efficiently
  So that this data can later be used for analysis and decision-making

  Scenario: Collecting order volume data
    Given the system is interfacing with the point of sale
    When an order is placed
    Then the order volume data should be collected

  Scenario: Collecting delivery efficiency data
    Given the system is interfacing with the delivery system
    When a delivery is completed
    Then the delivery efficiency data should be collected

  Scenario: Collecting popular menu item data
    Given the system is interfacing with the menu ordering platform
    When an item is ordered
    Then the popularity data of the menu item should be collected

  Scenario: Collecting user behavior data
    Given the system is interfacing with the user ordering platform
    When a user places an order
    Then the user's ordering behavior data should be collected
